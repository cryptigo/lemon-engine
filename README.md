# Lemon Engine
A basic 2D game engine.

## Description
Lemon Engine is a simple 2D game engine based off of GamesWithGabe's Java game engine series on YouTube.
Currently, the only supported backend is OpenGL, but Vulkan will be supported.

Lemon Engine is written on a Linux system. 
I have not yet implemented full compatibility support yet, sorry!

Currently, Lemon Engine is in a semi working state, as in you can compile without errors.
This doesn't mean all features will be working!

## Dependencies

* Gradle 6.3+
* Java 1.8+
